(a) Write a function that accepts a mark and returns the result.
    If the mark is less than 40, then the result is fail.
    If the mark is between 40 and 49, then the result is supplementary exam.
    Any mark equal to or above 50 is a pass. A final mark of 75 or greater than 75 is a distinction.
    Code the logic of deciding the result using if else if.

    Invoke the function using the marks 25, 40, 45, 50, 74 and 95, and display the results for each
    invocation. (6)

(b) Write a for loop that iterates 10 times.
    In each iteration it should generate a random number between 1 and 100,
    and determine whether the random number is even or odd.
    Display the random number generated and whether the number is odd or even. (5)
(c) Repeat (b) using a do while loop. (5)
(d) Write a while loop that iterates 10 times.
    In each iteration it should generate a random number between 1 and 4,
    and using a switch statement, it should display North for 1, South for 2, East for 3 and West for 4.
