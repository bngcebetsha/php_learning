/*
(a) Write a function that processes colon separated strings.
    In particular it should split (use explode())the given string into substrings where colon is found.
    For each substring stored in the array returned by explode(), display the substring,
    length of the substring (use strlen()) and the last character of the substring(use substring() with a negative integer value).

    Invoke the function using these two strings:
    I:am:Sam
    Too:good:to:be:true (10)

(b) Display the output generated by the following code and an explanation of what the code does using a nowdoc or a heredoc statement.

$today = new DateTime();
$futureDate = new DateTime('31-12-2022');
$difference = $today->diff($futureDate);
echo $difference->m;

(c) For an ICT module offered at Unisa,
    the 4th character in the module code represents the year in which the
    module is offered and the 5th character in the module code represents the
    NQF level of the module. As an example consider the module
    code ICT2611 – 2 in the code means that the module is offered at 2nd year
    and 6 in the code means that the module is offered at NQF level 6.

Write code for a function that accepts an ICT module code,
and displays the code, the respective year of offering as well
as the NQF level of the module in the function. (5)

(d) Write code to read and display the current date, and compute and display the date of next Saturday.
