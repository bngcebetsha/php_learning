Create a form that present the user with a choice of two products (use check boxes).
When the form is submitted, the base price (without value added tax (VAT))
of the selected product will be sent via the GET method to the same page. The script should do the following:
 a discount of 10% on the base price is calculated, which results in the discounted base price
 VAT of 15% is added to the discounted base price, which results in the final price
 The product selected, its base price, the discounted percentage (10%), the discounted
amount, the discounted base price, the amount of VAT charged, and the final price is presented to the user on separate lines.

//////// pseudocode
1) Search "how to create checkboxes in php"
2) Make the form dynamic, when submitted it must form a GET request to <where exactly?>
   and return the $productSelected string, $basePrice(before VAT and discount) of the product selected.
3) 
$discountPercentage = 0.1;
$vatPercentage = 0.15;
$discountedAmount = $basePrice * $discountPercentage;
$discountedBasePrice = $basePrice - $discountedAmount;
$vatAmountCharged = $basePrice * $vatPercentage;
$finalBasePrice = $basePrice + $vatAmountCharged - $discountedAmount;
4)
echo "The product {$productSelected$} has base price {$basePrice}, the discounted amount is {$discountedAmount}
the discounted base price is then {$discountedBasePrice}, the amount of VAT charged is {$vatAmountCharged} and so
the final price is {$finalBasePrice}"
